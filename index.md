We bring the radio era back:
RInD radio's goal is to prove that radio is, indeed, not dead! In this station, you'll have the opportunity to explore almost all kinds of music, ranging from Psychedelic/Classic/Progressive Rock, Jazz, Triphop, Celtic music and so much more! We hope you'll enjoy indulging in our plethora of music. Please keep in mind that this website is under construction (and to be exact, this whole radio station). Feel free to suggest songs as well as any other advice! E-Mail: hyiannios@gmail.com
